Currently we have two branches:
## master

Builds on the simple app in master, adds a SQLite DB, user registration and authorisation

## Installing
### Python 3.7+
You need to have at least Python 3.7 installed in your development environment.

### Dependencies 
To install the required dependencies:
```.bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv install --dev
pre-commit install
```
Note the app uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure we automatically run the [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) code formatter and [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) linter before each commit 

## Running Flask Bootstrap

### Create a .env file
Flask-Bootstrap installs [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to manage local environment variables it is strongly advised to create a ```.env``` file in the root of your project to store all environment variables.

### Running
To run ensure your virtual environment is running
```.bash
pipenv shell
flask run
```

### Tests
To run all tests
```bash
pytest tests
```

### API Docs
